so far, we have created our basic classes that read through the movies and users and puts their information in separate
classes as stated on the handout. We then started using each other's classes to fulfill our parts by making arguments to functions
instances of each other's classes. For me (Alex), I used their MovieBaseTL Class to get the user genre averages and also
to get the user genre preferences. While I (Tyler), utilized the UserDataAC class to add average ratings for movies.

For the rest of the project, we still need to complete number 7. For 7 it would seem best to use a set to recommend movies
so we do not get repeated movies since movies can have multiple genres. We can then continue to add movies until the list
reaches our destined amount of either 10, 30, or 50 depending on our choice. I (Tyler) might also have to figure out
how to get the AVL in order iteration functioning. Right now I currently have BALBOA running for the movie list
